# PyjamaCoin Weekly Changelog

Hey everyone, Emma here, back with another exciting update! ðŸŒŸ

After the loading screen, you'll be welcomed with a friendly **"Welcome"** message. This is where your PyjamaCoin adventure begins! ðŸš€ðŸ’«

Under the welcome message, you'll find a button that says, **"Let's start with your character."** Click on it, and the fun begins with naming your character. Give them a unique name that represents your style and personality. ðŸŒŸðŸ‘¾

Once you've named your character, the next button, **"Design your character,"** awaits. Here you can choose from four awesome pyjamas for your character. This is just the start; we want you to help us design even more! Join our Telegram group and share your ideas for a community pyjama. Your creativity could be part of the PyjamaCoin world! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ‘•ðŸ’¬

We're super excited to see what you come up with. Let's make PyjamaCoin as vibrant and unique as our community! ðŸ’¼âœ¨
