# PyjamaCoin Weekly Changelog

Hey folks! Emma here, your favorite UX/UI designer at PyjamaCoin! ðŸš€

It's time for another exciting update as we continue to shape the future of PyjamaCoin! This week, we're thrilled to share more of our design journey with you. ðŸ“±ðŸ’«

**New in this version:**

- **App Icon:** As you already know, our new app icon is ready and looking sharp on both iOS and Android. It's the first step in creating a cohesive and engaging user experience.
  
- **Loading Screen:** Next up, we've designed a sleek loading screen featuring our logo. This screen sets the tone for the entire app, giving you a glimpse of the PyjamaCoin brand as you wait to log in.

- **Login Screen:** Finally, we're introducing our brand-new login screen. It includes our logo, the text "PyjamaCoin," a prompt to "Please enter your details," and fields for your login and password. Of course, there's a login button, and if you don't have an account yet, there's a sign-up option too.

Stay tuned for next week's update where we'll reveal the registration process. We're also working on a video to showcase the entire app in action, complete with animations!

Exciting times ahead! Until next time, PyjamaCoin friends! ðŸ’¼âœ¨
