# PyjamaCoin Weekly Changelog

Hey PyjamaCoin friends, Emma here, your UX/UI designer! 🌟

Today, I’m excited to introduce a special feature that will add more fun to your PyjamaCoin journey: **your character's emotions**! 💤😄

**How does it work?** It's simple: the better your character’s mood, the more PyjamaCoins you earn while you sleep. The key is to keep your character happy. If they go to bed in a good mood, you’ll earn more money in your sleep – that’s our motto! 💰✨

Your character goes through different emotions, and it's up to you to keep them in a good state. There are a total of **five emotions** or modes:

1. **Normal:** The default state of your character.
2. **Happy:** Where you earn the most PyjamaCoins.
3. **Sad:** Lower earnings because your character isn’t feeling well.
4. **Angry:** No earnings; your character is dissatisfied.
5. **Sleeping:** The earning mode, depending on their mood before going to bed.

Your character will notify you when they need some love or attention. Maybe they want to be petted? You’ll receive a notification that your character wants to be petted. Click on it and hold a button for one minute to pet them and make them happy again. 🐾💖

There will always be new tasks to ensure your character stays content. Remember, the better you take care of them, the more PyjamaCoins you earn! 💼✨

Take care of your character, keep them happy, and earn while you sleep! Until next time, stay cozy with PyjamaCoin! 🛌💤
