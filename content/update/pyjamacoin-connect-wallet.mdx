# PyjamaCoin Weekly Changelog

Hey folks, Emma here, your go-to UX/UI designer at PyjamaCoin! 🚀

I'm excited to share a sneak peek of our latest feature: the **Connect Wallet** login! 📱🔐

We've been brainstorming and working closely with our app developer, and we're thrilled to introduce this new, secure way of logging in. Instead of the traditional email and password setup, you can now simply connect your wallet using one of your favorite providers like **TokenPocket**, **MetaMask**, **Trust Wallet**, and more. 🌐💼

Once you tap on the **"Connect Wallet"** button, a popup will appear where you can select your preferred wallet. It's a seamless and secure process designed to streamline your experience.

After verifying your wallet, you'll be greeted with a loading screen featuring our beloved PyjamaCoin logo. It's a small touch that adds a bit of flair while you wait. 🚀🪙

Stay tuned for more updates, and keep your feedback coming! We're building this together, and your input is invaluable.

Until next time, stay cozy with PyjamaCoin! ✨
